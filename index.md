# `rootown.io`

Designed to serve as an example for how a minimalistic, maintainable open data portal could look, `rootown.io` provides programmatic access to course scheduling records, facility mapping data, and campus dining info. It uses GitHub Actions workflows to process and validate data and GitHub Pages to host it. OpenAPI definitions are provided for exported JSON files to make them easy to develop against, and a Node.js package was developed to demonstrate its usage. Documentation outlining the design and maintenance of this architecture is spread throughout the repos.
